<h2>Rules:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>A match consists of 9 holes (3 short, 3 medium, 3 long) played on a putting mat by two players.</li>
    <li>The sequence of play is long-medium-short-long-medium-short-long-medium-short.</li>
    <li>The hole positions are marked by lines on the mat (see diagram above).</li>
    <li>The first hole is started by the player with the higher ranking (or chosen randomly). Each subsequent hole is
        started by the winner of the previous hole, or in case of a tie, by the player who started the previous hole.
    </li>
    <li>Each player plays the hole with their ball. The first player’s ball remains on the mat and can be knocked away.
    </li>
    <li>A ball that falls off the mat does not count towards the result. If both balls fall off, it is a tie for that
        hole – each player receives ½ a point.
    </li>
    <li>The player whose ball is closer to the center of the hole after both have played receives 1 point.</li>
    <li>If the distances are the same, both players receive ½ a point. Distances are judged "by eye."</li>
    <li>Match results are recorded on a dedicated website. One player enters the result, and the other confirms it.
        The result must total 9 points (e.g., 5-4 or 1-8).
    </li>
    <li>After confirmation, ranking points are recalculated by the system.</li>
    <li>The goal of the competition is to achieve the highest ranking by the end of the season and qualify for the final
        playoffs.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>End of Season:</h2>
<p>The season is planned to run from November 2024 to March 2025.</p>
<p>Final matches are scheduled for April to determine the putting champion. The format of the finals will be decided at
    a later date.</p>

<h2>Website:</h2>
<p>Anyone can access the website, but registering a match requires logging in.</p>
<p>Email, username, and password can be arbitrary – it is recommended to use a recognizable email address.</p>
